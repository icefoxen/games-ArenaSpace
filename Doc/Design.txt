okay, game.

Think EBF but with a Chrono Trigger combat engine, for now.

Except it's not exactly chrono trigger because there's more variety in positioning and movement.

We have an ATB-ish, FFX-ish timing system: Each action fills up a bar for that character, which drains at a constant pace, and when it's empty they get to do another action.

Monsters and players are positioned around the map.  There's a 'move' option, which takes more time the further you move.  Then the various attacks and powers have different ranges, AOE's, etc.


Patterns:
 * Point
 * Line
 * Circle
 * Cone
 * Cylinder



Party size: Variable, up to 6, on each side?  That seems good.

Art style: Flat sprites and such.  Start with stick figures, work from there.
Tiled backgrounds.

UI: Simple menu selections.

Base actions:
 * Move
 * Attack
 * Defend
 * Item

"Defend" is not the traditional "Oh well I'm just gonna parry and take damage".  It does that, but it also has a chance of counter-attacking anyone who attacks or moves near you...  It's overwatch, it presents you with an attack of opportunity.  Or at least a CHANCE of an attack of opportunity, since if it were certain there'd be no reason to ever not use it.  (Also it only works with basic attacks, can't attack-op with special powers.)



I think that I will start by defining an arena, with background, edges, and some sort of terrain map (movable vs. immovable areas).

Then I will define characters to go in it, with teams, positions, basic attacks, hit points, and death.

Then I will have to have some sort of input.

Then I will make timing work properly.
